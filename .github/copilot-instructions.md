This is a Rails app.

## General

- Use `bin/rails` to run Rails commands
- Don't run `bin/rails test:system` because it timeouts on the Copilot Environment
- Check CONTRIBUTING.md for development commands

## Before any commit

- Make sure tests pass
- Make sure there are no linter offences
- Make sure there are no security vulnerabilities (run brakeman)
